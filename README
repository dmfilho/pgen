Parser Generator for C99 

The parser generator (pgen) is able to generate parsers for C99 with support for the UTF-8 charset. The
pgen was developed in C++11.

It provides a way to describe both the lexical analyzer and the syntax analyzer on a single YAML file.

It is currently under development. In the near future it will accept LL(*) grammars and LALR(1) grammars.

Dependences:
 * yaml-cpp
 * boost (for yaml-cpp)
 * cppunit (for testing)
