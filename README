Parser Generator for C99 

The parser generator (pgen) is able to generate parsers for C99 with support for the UTF-8 charset. The
pgen was developed in C++11.

It provides a way to describe both the lexical analyzer and the syntax analyzer on a single YAML file.

The parser generator is currently under development.

Features:
 * Integrated Lexical Analyzer Generator with UTF-8 regular expression support
 * Supports the definition of custom named regular expression classes
 * UTF-8 Support
 * Recursive Descent LL(*) Parser Generator
 * Generates C99 code
 * Reads all lexical and syntactic definitions from a single YAML file
 * Automatically Generates Abstract Syntax Trees
 * Supports the definition of states for the Lexical Analyzer

Dependences:
 * yaml-cpp
 * boost (for yaml-cpp)
 * cppunit (for testing)
 * gcc (for testing)

Planned (Future) Changes:
 * More Unit Tests
 * Documentation
 * Benchmarking
 * LALR(1) parser generator
